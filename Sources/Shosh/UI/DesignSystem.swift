/// Direction: 1980s portable field recorders and cassette decks — Sony TC-D5, Marantz PMD,
/// Nakamichi, Braun. Equipment, not theme. Every value a view needs lives here; components
/// never declare their own colors, sizes, radii or durations.
///
/// Two faces, the way decks actually shipped: **silver face** (brushed aluminum, the TC-D5)
/// in light appearance, **black face** (matte, the PMD) in dark. Same tokens, same names,
/// different material — so a view is written once and both faces work.
///
/// The rules that keep this from drifting into pastiche:
/// - One accent: the record lamp red. Nothing else in the app is red.
/// - Amber and green appear only on level instrumentation, never as UI color.
/// - Radii stay small. Equipment has hard edges and visible seams.
/// - Depth comes from bevels and inset shadows, never from glow or blur.
